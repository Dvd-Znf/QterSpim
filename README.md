# QterSpim  
  
A cuter frontend for the assembly language MIPS R2000/R3000 simulator.  
Forked from [SPIM](https://sourceforge.net/projects/spimsimulator/), this repo hosts the UI interface code and aims to make it a more modern and richer experience with built-in assembly editing.  
  
QterSpim is a self-contained Simulator/IDE that runs MIPS32 assembly language programs.   
It also provides a minimal set of operating system services.  
  
## Instalation
WIP!  

## Getting started
WIP!  

## Development
QterSpim uses the [Qt framework](https://doc.qt.io/) to provide a native GUI interface across all platforms.  
- The `QtSpim/` directory contains the root of the Qt project  
- The `CPU/` backend is kept and managed [separatly](https://github.com/Dvd-Znf/Spim-CPU)  

### Prelude

You will need to install the relevant toolkits for your platform,  
You should have access to these tools: `qmake`, `uic`, `make`, `bison` and a C++ compiler.

You can use whatever editor you wish.  
While the original project recommended using QtCreator, I wouldn't.  
QtDesigner likes to get a bit quirky at night on my machine,  

The `QtSpim.pro` file has been patched and _should_ work fine by default on all platforms now.  

### Building
#### First time setup
Inside `QtSpim/` run `qmake`,  
This will genarate a `Makefile` which will be used from now on.  

#### Compiling
Running `make` will build the executable `QtSpim`,  
If you edit any of the source files and then subsequently run `make` again,  
Only the changed files will be recompiled.  

Changes to resources outside ui, C++ or header files will require a clean build, see bellow

#### Clean
`make clean` will remove produced object files  
`make distclean` will remove everything, including the Makefile itself  

### Notes on the VCS transition
Original Subversion revisions/commits have been lost in the process of forking and swithing to git.   
The root git commit is also _not_ the last SVN revision from SourceForge, it already contains _a lot_ of patches,  
See root commit message for a changelog.  

### The original project has been retired:
> SPIM is no longer supported.   
> The code has been stable for many years, with a few occasional bugs.   
> But, as I reach retirement, it is clear to me that SPIM should retire as well.   
> Feel free to fork a copy and fix the bugs yourself!
